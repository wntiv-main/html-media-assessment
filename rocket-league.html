				<h2>About The Game</h2>
				<p>
					Rocket League is a vehicular soccer video game developed and published by Psyonix. The game was
					first released for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4 in July 2015, with ports for Xbox One and
					Nintendo Switch being released later on. In June 2016, 505 Games began distributing a physical
					retail version for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, with Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment taking
					over those duties by the end of 2017. Versions for macOS and Linux were also released in 2016, but
					support for their online services was dropped in 2020. The game went free-to-play in September 2020.
				</p>
				<p>
					Described as "soccer, but with rocket-powered cars", Rocket League has up to eight players assigned
					to each of the two teams, using rocket-powered vehicles to hit a ball into their opponent's goal and
					score points over the course of a match. The game includes single-player and multiplayer modes that
					can be played both locally and online, including cross-platform play between all versions. Later
					updates for the game enabled the ability to modify core rules and added new game modes, including
					ones based on ice hockey and basketball.

				<p>
					Rocket League is a sequel to Psyonix's Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars, a 2008 video
					game for the PlayStation 3. Battle-Cars received mixed reviews and was not a success, but gained a
					loyal fan base. Psyonix continued to support themselves through contract development work for other
					studios while looking to develop a sequel. Psyonix began formal development of Rocket League around
					2013, refining the gameplay from Battle-Cars to address criticism and fan input. Psyonix also
					recognized their lack of marketing from Battle-Cars and engaged in both social media and promotions
					to market the game, including offering the game for free for PlayStation Plus members on release.
				</p>
				<p>
					Rocket League was praised for its gameplay improvements over Battle-Cars, as well as its graphics
					and overall presentation, although some criticism was directed towards the game's physics engine.
					The game earned a number of industry awards, and saw over 10 million sales and 40 million players by
					the beginning of 2018. Rocket League has also been adopted as an esport, with professional players
					participating through ESL and Major League Gaming along with Psyonix's own Rocket League
					Championship Series (RLCS).
