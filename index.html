            <h1>Who runs it?</h1>
            <p>
                CHS eSports is run by the teaching staff in the Digital technologies department. Each Digitech teacher is responsible for a range of games but each is only responsible for 1 game at a time. The choice of eSports games being offered is selected at the start of each year.
                •	Mrs Cropp: Current responsible for League of Legends but also Valorant when it is offered
                •	Mr Thomson: Currently responsible for Rocket League but also Project Cars when it is offered
                •	Mr Gibson: Currently responsible for Minecraft but also Destiny 2 when it is offered.                    
            </p>
            <h1>Practice Times</h1>
            <p>
                These can and do vary from term to term, but currently the practice times are as follows.
                Game	Days	When 	Where
                League of Legends	Tuesday	Lunchtimes	C5
                Rocket League	Wednesdays	Lunchtimes	C5

            </p>
            <h1>Teams &amp; Competitions</h1>
            <p>
                Teams are organized into two categories.
                Internal Teams: Those that play each other within school
                External Teams: Those that represent CHS when competing against other schools.
                Currently there are number of internal teams for each game currently competing on a casual basis. This is expected to become more of a house-based activity in the near future.
                As for external teams, we currently have 2 teams of senior players competing in the annual NZ League of Legends High School League, and 4 teams of Juniors competing in the Local Christchurch Minecraft competition. Recruitment for 2023 teams to compete in Valorant, Project Cars &amp; Destiny 2 will star in November of this year.
            </p>
            <h1>Rules</h1>
            <p>
                All games typically follow the conventional gaming rules as specified by the International Esports Federation (https://iesf.org/governance/regulations) but in addition to these the following are applicable to CHS eSports teams and events.
                All participating students MUST…	
                •	Be achieving and up to date with school-based assessments and coursework expectations.
                •	Have maintained at least a 90% attendance record for all classes.
                •	Agree to represent the school in a positive manner.
                •	Have provided written approval to compete from a parent or guardian.                    
            </p>
            <h1>Contact</h1>
            <p>
