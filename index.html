                <p>
                    CHS eSports is run by the teaching staff in the Digital technologies department. Each Digitech
                    teacher is responsible for a range of games but each is only responsible for 1 game at a time. The
                    choice of eSports games being offered is selected at the start of each year.
                </p>

                <h2>Teams &amp; Competitions</h2>
                <p>Teams are organized into two categories:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Internal Teams: Those that play each other within school</li>
                    <li>External Teams: Those that represent CHS when competing against other schools</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Currently there are number of internal teams for each game currently competing on a casual basis.
                    This
                    is expected to become more of a house-based activity in the near future. As for external teams, we
                    currently have 2 teams of senior players competing in the annual NZ League of Legends High School
                    League, and 4 teams of Juniors competing in the Local Christchurch Minecraft competition.
                    Recruitment
                    for 2023 teams to compete in Valorant, Project Cars &amp; Destiny 2 will star in November of this
                    year.

                <h2>Rules</h2>
                <p>
                    All games typically follow the conventional gaming rules as specified by the International Esports
                    Federation (<a href="https://iesf.org/governance/regulations">iesf.org/governance/regulations</a>)
                    but in addition to these the following are applicable to CHS eSports teams and events. All
                    participating
                    students MUST:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Be achieving and up to date with school-based assessments and coursework expectations.</li>
                    <li>Have maintained at least a 90% attendance record for all classes.</li>

                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Contact</h2>
                <p>
                    The primary contact for eSports at CHS is the designated esports prefect who will typically be able
                    to
                    answer any question you may have.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a class="email">chs_eports@cashmere.school.nz</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Alternatively, you can contact either of the teachers responsible
                    for each of the individual games offered.
