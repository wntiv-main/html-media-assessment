				<h2>About The Game</h2>
				<p>
					League of Legends (LoL), commonly referred to as League, is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena
					video game developed and published by Riot Games. Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom map
					for Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in the same genre. Since its
					release in October 2009, the game has been free-to-play and is monetized through purchasable
					character customization. The game is available for Microsoft Windows and macOS.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the game, two teams of five players battle in player versus player combat, each team occupying
					and defending their half of the map. Each of the ten players controls a character, known as a
					"champion", with unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match, champions become
					more powerful by collecting experience points, earning gold, and purchasing items to defeat the
					opposing team. In the game's main mode, Summoner's Rift, a team wins by pushing through to the enemy
					base and destroying their "Nexus", a large structure located within.

				<p>
					League of Legends received generally positive reviews; critics highlighted its accessibility,
					character designs, and production value. The game's long lifespan has resulted in a critical
					reappraisal, with reviews trending positively. The negative and abusive in-game behavior of its
					players, criticized since early in the game's lifetime, persists despite Riot's attempts to fix the
					problem. In 2019, the game regularly peaked at eight million concurrent players, and its popularity
					has led to tie-ins such as music videos, comic books, short stories, and an animated series, Arcane.
					Its success has also spawned several spin-off video games, including a mobile version, a digital
					collectible card game and a turn-based role-playing game, among others. A massively multiplayer
					online role-playing game based on the property is in development.
				</p>
				<p>
					The game is often cited as the world's largest esport, with an international competitive scene
					composed of 12 leagues. The domestic leagues culminate in the annual League of Legends World
					Championship. The 2019 championship had over 100 million unique viewers, peaking at a concurrent
					viewership of 44 million. Domestic and international events have been broadcast on livestreaming
					websites such as Twitch, YouTube, Bilibili, as well as cable television sports channel ESPN.
