                Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by the Swedish video game developer Mojang Studios. The game was created by Markus
                "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language. Following several early private testing versions, it was
                first made public in May 2009 before fully releasing in November 2011, with Jens Bergensten then taking over
                development. Minecraft has since been ported to several other platforms and is the best-selling video game
                of all time, with over 238 million copies sold and nearly 140 million monthly active users as of 2021.

                In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally generated 3D world with virtually infinite terrain, and
                may discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures or earthworks. Depending
                on game mode, players can fight computer-controlled mobs, as well as cooperate with or compete against other
                players in the same world. Game modes include a survival mode, in which players must acquire resources to
                build the world and maintain health, and a creative mode, where players have unlimited resources and access
                to flight. Players can modify the game to create new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets.

                Minecraft has been critically acclaimed, winning several awards and being cited as one of the greatest video games of all
                time. Social media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise, and the annual Minecon conventions played large roles
                in popularizing the game. The game has also been used in educational environments to teach chemistry, computer-aided
                design, and computer science. In 2014, Mojang and the Minecraft intellectual property were purchased by Microsoft
                for US$2.5 billion. A number of spin-off games have also been produced, such as Minecraft: Story Mode, Minecraft
                Dungeons, and Minecraft Earth.
